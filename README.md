# Website

This repository contains a minimal static website starter.

Files added:

- [index.html](index.html) — main homepage
- [styles.css](styles.css) — site styles

How to view locally:

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser by double-clicking it.
2. Or run a quick static server from the project folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Next steps:

- Edit `index.html` to add your content.
- Replace colors, fonts, and assets in `styles.css` as needed.
